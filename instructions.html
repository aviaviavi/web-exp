		Imagine you are a public health official trying to identify new contagious diseases. 
		Some diseases are contagious and so can be transmitted from person to person, whereas others are genetic, 
		and will not be transmitted person to person.

		You will see a series of videos that represent the timecourse of various diseases in one city.

		The whole map is the layout of the city, and each house represents where each family lives in the city. Initially 
		all the houses are grey because as far as we know they are not sick.
		If a house turns red, that means someone in that family became sick.

			<img id="example_sim" src="icons/Screenshot.png"></br></br>
		</div>

	<div align="center">
		<p>Click the button to see the infection animation</p>
		<img id="example_house" src="icons/53-house.png">
	</br></br> 
		<button id="demo_button" type="button" onclick="showExample()">Infect!</button>
	</br></br></br></br>
	</div>

		Your job is to watch each video and decide whether the disease in question is contagious or genetic. 
		You will rate how confident you are on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 means that you are confident the disease 
		is not contagious, it is genetic and 100 means that you are confident that the disease is contagious, not genetic.</p>
